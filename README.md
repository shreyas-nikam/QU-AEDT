# AEDT

## Introduction

- The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) is implementing rules for automated employment decision tools (AEDTs) based on Local Law 144 of 2021. [link](https://www.nyc.gov/site/dca/about/automated-employment-decision-tools.page)
- AEDTs cannot be used by employers or employment agencies without undergoing a bias audit and making the audit results public.
- The bias audit must analyze selection rates for different demographic groups and compare them to detect potential biases.
- Rules clarify terms, audit requirements, publication standards for audit results, and notice obligations for employees and job candidates.
- Overall, the rules aim to ensure compliance with the law and promote fairness in employment practices involving AEDTs.
- It is a process conducted by employers or employment agencies to assess the fairness of an automated employment decision tool (AEDT) in selecting candidates for employment or promotion.
- It ensures that AEDTs don't unfairly discriminate based on sex, race/ethnicity, or intersectional categories by analyzing selection or scoring patterns and comparing them across demographic groups.
